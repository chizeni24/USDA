Mesonet stations that are stationed on farmers land.
I believe the soil moisture have 

slope
soil texture - they are two soil textures
- 

- Discharge is a seperate target.

we can have land use and tillage system to see if we can use connect and see 
- do we know the depth of the base flow?
-- what is the max depth in the soil moisture 


- -Fine sandy loam - Silty clay loam (FSL - SICL)

- -Loamy fine sand- Fine sandy loam- Sandy Loamy- Loamy (LFS-FSL-SL-L)


- Create better presentation

- Get teh latitude and longitude at eah station so we can get the climate change dataset of those location and project long /short term into the future.

- lags can generate noise, could the large time affect the discharge.

As temperature goes beyond 20 celcius the value of the temperature


daily data will be better than weekly??????
- rolling average of the timestamp



soil moistures are within the range 0.1 to 0.35



---
open ET with latitude and longitude
-Google earth engine we can get the daily ET.


The match between the spatial yeild county and the climate.


winter wheat and the measure specific climate and irrigation system.


--- fine tuning and finding a location that has the complete dataset of crop yeild and climate is.


-- prism precipitation ----
for the latitude.


what wheat is it that we have as this can alter the data




## Takes from meeting 


I think the “time series (lag) + regression” would be a better choice as the antecedant moisture content is always a crucial factor

in soil moisture predictions in practice.   

 

SM at these sites appear to respond to precip (and perhaps to base flow) rapidly – typically on the order of day or a few days. Therefore, if we do

weekly analysis, we may be losing some important information during the model training. However, I agree with Debaditya that noise in daily data

could reduce the prediction accuracy of the models.  Would it be possibly to try it first on a daily basis to see how AI models perform? If their

predictive performance turned out to be not good, we may alternatively try to implement 3-day rolling average, which – I believe - should capture the dynamics.

Does this sound reasonable?
